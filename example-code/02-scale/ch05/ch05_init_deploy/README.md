## Initial deployment

Example scripts to quickly spin up a load balanced ghost blog with a MariaDB Galera cluster. This example only spins up a single application node which can be altered using the `node_count` variable in **terraform.tfvars**, however, this example doesn't include the use of a storage module that would allow ghost to use DigitalOcean Spaces.

If you haven't already created a self-signed TLS certificate you can do so by running `certifyme` script in the **bin** directory.

The next step on the list is to fill in the variables in your **terraform.tfvars** file. With that set you can run `terraform init` and follow up with `terraform apply` to get your Droplets created.

Ansible also requires some variables be set so don't forget to fill in **group_vars/*/vault.yml** with the appropriate info. You can use `ansible-vault encrypt` on the file if you'd like.
